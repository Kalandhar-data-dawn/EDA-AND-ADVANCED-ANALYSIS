# üìä EDA & Analytics Project

## üßæ Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive collection of SQL scripts** for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.  
The analyses include **database exploration, measure evaluation, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation**, and more.

The repository is designed to help **Data Analysts** and **BI Professionals** efficiently explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database.

Each SQL script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates **best practices** for query design and optimization.

## üîÑ Project Flow: Data Analytics Process

This project follows a **structured Data Analytics Workflow**, divided into two key phases:  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Analytics**.

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Focuses on understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and uncovering key data characteristics.

Includes the following steps:
- Database Exploration  
- Dimensions Exploration  
- Date Exploration  
- Measures Exploration  
- Magnitude Analysis  
- Ranking (**Top N / Bottom N**)

---

### **2. Advanced Analytics**
Derives deeper insights and evaluates performance through analytical methods.

Covers:
- Change-Over-Time (**Trends**)  
- Cumulative Analysis  
- Performance Analysis  
- Part-to-Whole (**Proportional**) Analysis  
- Data Segmentation  
- Reporting
