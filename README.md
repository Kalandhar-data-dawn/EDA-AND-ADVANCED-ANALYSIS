# EDA AND ADVANCED ANALYSIS
# üìä EDA & Analytics Project 
## üßæ Overview This project presents a comprehensive collection of **SQL scripts** for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.   The analyses include **database exploration**, **measure evaluation**, **time-based trends**, **cumulative analytics**, **segmentation**, and more.   
The repository is designed to help **data analysts** and **BI professionals** efficiently explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database.   
Each SQL script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for query design and optimization.  
---  ## üß© Dataset  This project uses **three primary tables**: 
### **1. Customers** customer_key customer_id customer_number first_name last_name country marital_status gender birthdate create_date  markdown Copy code 
### **2. Sales** order_number product_key customer_key order_date shipping_date due_date sales_amount quantity price  markdown Copy code  
### **3. Products** product_key product_id product_number product_name category_id category subcategory maintenance cost product_line start_date  yaml Copy code  
---  ## üîÑ Project Flow: Data Analytics Process  This project follows a structured 
**Data Analytics Workflow**, divided into two key phases:   
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Analytics**.  
### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** Focuses on understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and uncovering key data characteristics.   Includes the following steps: - Database Exploration   - Dimensions Exploration   - Date Exploration   - Measures Exploration   - Magnitude Analysis   - Ranking (Top N / Bottom N)  ###
**2. Advanced Analytics** Derives deeper insights and evaluates performance through analytical methods.   Covers: - Change-Over-Time (Trends)   - Cumulative Analysis   - Performance Analysis   - Part-to-Whole (Proportional) Analysis   - Data Segmentation   - Reporting 

---  ## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Skills Used  ### **Tools** - **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì utilized for initial data cleaning, validation, and exploratory data analysis.
